<h2 id="总结">总结</h2>

<p>要解决什么问题（领域+本文）</p>

<ul>
<li>对于拓扑多变量时间序列的异常检测任务是：给定个历史滑动窗口的数据$S(X_t∣X_{t−w:t−1},E)$来判定观测点$X_t$的数据是否异常。</li>
</ul>

<p>值得借鉴的地方有哪些</p>

<ul>
<li>Spatiotemporal</li>
<li>实验非常充分，7个RQ</li>
</ul>

<p>不足有哪些</p>

<ul>
<li>模型太复杂了</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spatiotemporal">Spatiotemporal</h2>

<p>标题 “A Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Approach for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Cloud Systems”中的Spatiotemproal的解读：</p>

<ul>
<li>Temporal Model：时序模型（LSTM）</li>
<li>Spatial Model：空间模型（Graph）</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple-Metrics拓扑信息的+组件级的输入构成了系统级的信息，可以更全面地了解整个运行系统。利用Multiple-Metrics就可以用来构造空间模型。</p>

<h2 id="graphlstm">GraphLSTM</h2>

<p>那么Spatiotemporal是如何体现的？</p>

<p>图神经网络的特征提取器共享于来自不同组件的同类指标之间，有助于在统一的特征学习下捕获相同指标类型之间的相似模式。</p>

<p>GraphLSTM的主要思路是将LSTM中的全连接网络之前增加一个GNN，对拓扑信息和指标信息进行融合。</p>

<p>数据分为两类（如Fig.3、Fig.4所示）：</p>

<ol>
<li>指标矩阵，横坐标是节点Node，纵坐标是指标Metric。</li>
<li>连接矩阵，主要是edge的向量矩阵，每个edge为一个列向量。</li>
</ol>

<p>GraphLSTM的主要思路是将LSTM中的全连接网络之前增加一个GNN，对拓扑信息和指标信息进行融合。</p>

<p><img src="../../../docs/imgs/image-20211117190631965.png" alt="image-20211117190631965" /></p>

<p>对比一下LSTM的计算公式和融合后的公式，替换了外部输入。也就在之前添加了GNN作为拓扑信息和Metric信息的融合层，融合之后作为标准LSTM的输入。其中： “$∗g$” denotes the graph neural operator and “$∗$” denotes the Hadamard product。</p>

<p>融合公式和LSTM原公式相比就是多了后面的$E$：</p>

<h2 id="实验-数据集">实验&amp;数据集</h2>

<p>RQ可以写7个？？！！没毛病。这7个RQ选取的角度其实很全面，非常值得参考。</p>

<p>两个数据集MBD和MMS可以看看里面长什么样子，取一行看一下也知道个大概，和Fig.4模型的input一起看比较清晰：</p>

<h2 id="q-a">Q&amp;A</h2>

<p><strong>Mutivariate time series体现在哪里？</strong></p>

<p>还是看Fig.4，输入不是一个服务，而是多个服务，而且对于每个服务都有不同的指标。时序数据$X={X_0,X_1,&hellip;.,X_t}$，这里面X序列的一个元素就是一个矩阵。</p>

<p><strong>不论是MDB还是MMS数据集的矩阵E都是两行数据，怎么理解矩阵E？</strong></p>

<p><strong>不加Graph效果就不好吗？</strong></p>

<p><strong>VAE在这里面起什么作用？</strong></p>
